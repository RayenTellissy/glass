//! GPU rendering for Glass: wgpu device and queue ownership, the render graph compiler,
//! compositor nodes, WGSL shaders, text, masks, LUTs, scopes, the VRAM frame cache, the
//! async readback ring, import of platform frame handles as textures, and the
//! presentation API the UI uses to show the preview. `unsafe` is allowed only in
//! `render::interop`.
